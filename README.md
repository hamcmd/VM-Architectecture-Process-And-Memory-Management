# VM-Architectecture-Process-And-Memory-Management

This is a java based project in which we are mimicing a VM architecture and managing processes and memory. 

## Phase I (VM Architecture)
### What to do?
* Build main architecture
* Implement instruction set

## Phase 2 (Process and Memory Management)
